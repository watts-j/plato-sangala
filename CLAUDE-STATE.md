# Plato Sangala — Project State

Last updated: 2026-05-05

## Reference Versions

- **v2.29-sangala** — Reverts v2.28's KFMon experiment; keeps v2.27's minimal-tgz layout, autostart bumped from `sleep 9` to `sleep 12` (next tag).
- **v2.28-sangala** — Tried to restore v2.19's KFMon-based launch. Backfired: v2.3's on-animator.sh starts KFMon AND forks plato-autostart.sh, so two launchers raced and every boot hung on dots, not just the first. Do not use.
- **v2.27-sangala** — Minimal KoboRoot.tgz / shell-autostart approach. First-boot hangs because of fixed 9s sleep; subsequent boots work.
- **v2.19-sangala** — Last build using KFMon + NickelMenu via v2.3-derived KoboRoot.tgz. May or may not actually have worked on Clara BW — never verified.
- **v2.3-sangala-full-build** — Original baseline.

## Fresh install hang

**Cause.** `plato-autostart.sh` in v2.20–v2.27 used `pidof nickel` + a fixed `sleep 9` before calling `plato.sh`. On factory-reset Clara BW, Nickel takes longer than 9s to finish its boot animation phase, so plato.sh kills Nickel mid-init and the loading dots loop runs forever.

**v2.28 attempt (failed).** Reintroduced KFMon's `on_boot = true` from v2.3's KoboRoot.tgz and kept plato-autostart.sh as a "fallback". v2.3's `on-animator.sh` both starts KFMon and forks plato-autostart.sh; both then call plato.sh, which calls `killall -TERM nickel ... fmon`, and they race each other. Every boot hung on dots. Reverted in v2.29.

**v2.29 fix.** Stay on v2.27's minimal KoboRoot.tgz layout; bump `sleep 9` to `sleep 12` in plato-autostart.sh.

**Recovery from v2.28.** Factory reset (hold LIGHT during power-on for ~10s) is the cleanest path. Without a reset, installing v2.29 will overwrite `on-animator.sh` with the slim no-KFMon version, leaving the v2.3-derived KFMon binaries inert in `/usr/local/kfmon/`.

## Next Tag Number

**v2.28-sangala**

## Package Structure

Two packages produced per release:
- **`-install.tar.gz`** — For new/factory-reset devices. Includes `.kobo/KoboRoot.tgz`.
- **`-update.tar.gz`** — For devices that already have Plato installed. No KoboRoot.tgz.
- **`install-sangala.ps1`** — Separate download. PowerShell installer script.

**Installer script**: `sangala/installer/install-sangala.ps1` — auto-detects Kobo by volume name "KOBOeReader", determines install vs update, cleans up old non-dot library folders, copies files.

## Branch

`claude/customize-plato-ui-1Edbm`

## User Working Directory

`C:\Users\jbw3r\plato-sangala`

## Device

Kobo Clara BW (model spaBW/spaBWTPV), 1072x1448 @ 300 DPI

## Architecture

- Auto-launch: `plato-autostart.sh` in system partition (installed via KoboRoot.tgz). Waits for `pidof nickel` then sleeps 12s, then execs `plato.sh`.
- No KFMon, no NickelMenu.
- KoboRoot.tgz is the committed minimal `sangala/kobo-assets/KoboRoot.tgz` (~1KB): only `etc/init.d/on-animator.sh` (slim, no KFMon hook) and `usr/local/bin/plato-autostart.sh`.
- Dictionary: Wiktionary English (StarDict format), converted on-device on first use (~1-2 min)
- Metadata extraction: title and author only (series, year, publisher, categories ignored)
- Dictionary rendering: HTML-aware (definitions containing `<` rendered as HTML)
- Library folders: dot-prefixed (.STEM, .Humanities, etc.) to hide from Nickel's scanner
- EPUB font-size: pinch/spread gestures adjust by 0.5pt steps on reflowable docs

## Known Issues / Pending

- **Fresh install hang**: addressed in v2.29 by bumping autostart sleep from 9s to 12s. Validate with a factory-reset Clara BW + v2.29 install package. If 12s is still too short on factory-reset, bump further.
- **Home landing page**: Not yet implemented. Previous HomeImage overlay approach crashed. Next approach: modify Shelf renderer to show image when books list is empty. `selected-library = 5` (Menu, empty library) works as of v2.16/v2.20.
- **`home-image` setting**: Still in Settings.toml and settings struct but not used in Home view code (disabled after crashes). Path: `/mnt/onboard/.adds/plato/resources/home.png`
- **Boot delay**: Currently 9s. Can be reduced further if testing shows stability.
- **Installer script paths**: Currently hardcoded to v2.24 paths. Needs parameterization for new versions.
- **Installer script download**: .ps1 file uploads to GitHub release successfully but may not be visible in the UI. Consider zipping it.
- **Stale library folders**: When updating from pre-v2.25 builds, old non-dot library folders (STEM/, Humanities/, etc.) must be deleted. Installer script handles this, but manual installs do not.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. Never create custom system scripts (on-animator.sh) from scratch — use proven ones
2. KoboRoot.tgz is reprocessed every time files are loaded; separate install and update packages
3. `selected-library = X` works on its own but crashed when combined with HomeImage overlay
4. Dictionary pre-conversion in CI produced a 76MB index too large for device RAM
5. StarDict on-device conversion (v2.17 approach) works and is fast (~1-2 min first use)
6. Always check the reference version before making assumptions about package structure
7. The v2.3-sangala-full-build release on GitHub is the original source of KFMon/NickelMenu binaries
8. Plato reads `belongs-to-collection` for series metadata even when Calibre doesn't show it — strip unwanted metadata fields in extraction code
9. For long sessions, start fresh and read CLAUDE-STATE.md for context
10. Don't reach for a non-trivial fix until you've ruled out a one-line one. The fresh-install hang may simply need a slightly longer post-Nickel sleep, not a marker-based gate or KFMon revival.
11. Nickel ignores directories starting with `.` — use dot-prefixed library folders to prevent Nickel from scanning EPUBs
12. Shell glob `*` does not match dot-files/directories — use `shopt -s dotglob` in bash
13. v2.20 (commit `0189d82`) introduced the minimal KoboRoot.tgz and removed KFMon. v2.28 tried to undo that and made things worse — putting KFMon back alongside our plato-autostart.sh creates two competing launchers, since v2.3's on-animator.sh starts both. If KFMon is ever reintroduced, plato-autostart.sh must be removed (or made a no-op) at the same time.
14. Trust git history over CLAUDE-STATE.md. Verify claims against `git ls-tree`/`git diff` before acting on them.
15. Inspect the actual built artifact (download the install tarball, extract KoboRoot.tgz, read the scripts) before declaring a fix complete. Building correctly does not imply running correctly.
